		<p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process
		between clients and developers was flawed. All to often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage;
		resulting in a final product that fail sto reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>

		<p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication
		and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project; not only do I work to craft the application according to the client specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client goals.
		The end result is the right product, delivered on time and on budget.</p>
